### Using

To create a new shortened url: post a JSON body to the `/url` endpoint in the form of `{"url":"TO_SHORTEN_URL"}`

```
$ curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/travel/36-hours-in-barcelona-spain.html"}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/url
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 44

{"smally_url":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/9h5k4"}
```

Then in a browser paste the shortened URL to be redirected to the original URL or use [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manual.html):

```
$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8080/9h5k4
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
